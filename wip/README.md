# Ideas and Work in Progress

In this directory there are the blog articles that aren't finished yet.
It is important for me to share drafts as well, so feedback can be collected
quickly, so my vulernability can help others be more courageous, and so we can
learn from each other's experience.

# Ideas

 * Design Thinking and Leadership
   * core idea of D.T. is splitting idea generation from decision making
   * same can apply in many leadership situations
   * E.g. what causes does your employee's problem have besides the one he is
     thinking about?
   * E.g. what is he actually trying to achieve by solving the problem?
   * E.g. what opportunities may lay hidden inside the problem?
   * E.g. what solution options have not been considered yet because they are
     too frightening, too impossible, too crazy, too much like one of your
     parents might have done it?
   * Don't judge in ideation phase. The key point is to give affirmation and
     courage with phrases like "Yeah, let's put it on the list!"
   * When you think you're done, then ask one more powerful question:
     "And what else?"
 * The Five Love Languages in the workplace
   * many work situations can lead to an experienced disconnect
   * many interpersonal problems are actually a lack or loss of connection
   * build longer lasting relationships by showing your care in a language the
     other person can understand
   * the Five Love Languages may help you descover what the other person needs:
     * Acts of Service
     * Receiving Gifts
     * Quality Time
     * Words of Affirmation
     * Physical Touch
 * Sales is not a Funnel; it's a Mountain
   * no need to push, squeeze or filter out people
   * everybody has a problem right now (the mountain)
   * be the supporter, ally and friend they need (to get on top)
   * people will naturally go to someone they trust and consider and expert
   * if nobody asks for your help, think about how to show your expertise
   * if people ask for your help, confirm that they understand their problem,
     your expertise, and whether your expertise can actually help them
