# Let's Talk

We all want to work in teams where people speak up about the serious problems,
mistakes and misunderstandings, but somehow it rarely happens. Did you notice,
how you as well avoid the necessary conflicts?

In this article we will speak about:
 * What are we so frickin afraid of?
 * What is happening inside of us when we receive different kinds of feedback?
 * What can we do to gain more courage to speak up?
 * How can we turn our fears into fruitful discussions?
 * What are small steps we can take right now?


## What are we so frickin afraid of?

What can happen when you speak up? The other person might not listen to you,
leaving you stranded. Or you might make them angry. Or your relationship might
deteriorate if they cannot accept your feedback. If they have some influence
over you, you might even end up losing your job or marriage. And on top of that
you might find later on that you were wrong.

So there are a lot of things that can go wrong and it is even possible to have
long term negvative effects from speaking up. There is no denying it.

But there are also negative effects of not speaking up: You might lose
your passion, you might end up producing worse results than you could have,
you might lose customers, work on the wrong project altogether, hurt each
other, put yourself or others in depression and burn-out, deteriorate your
health.

Wouldn't it be great if we could avoid both outcomes somehow? Well, here's the
good part:

    **You can!**

Yes, you've read that correctly. It is possible. And if you think about it, you
also know people who can have tough conversations but are still loved and
respected by their peers. There is also no magic sauce. It can be learned.
And you can see results even if you only take small steps!

What you need to get there is an understanding of how different kind of
feedback works on us humans - yes, including you - as well as a few tools and
skills. Let's talk!

## Our reaction to negative feedback

You probably remember the last time a parent, teacher or boss gave you negative
feedback about some work you've done. How did that make you feel?

Even if you expected that feedback, it probably hit you somewhat by surprise,
right? You might have become tense already in anticipation. After hearing it,
your face and hands might have become very cold or hot. Maybe you even started
sweating. Your arms and legs might have started shaking.

And even in your mind you were not your normal self. Thoughts were racing
through it, thoughts about why it was not your fault or actually someone
else's. Or your mind was completely blank and empty, making you struggle to
even find the right words.

The response you gave probably was angry and hurtful, or needy and full of
excuses, or maybe even complete silence. In either case, it probably was not
your true self speaking.

And after thinking about it for some time, you might have found that there was
actually some truth in the feedback and you start wishing that you reacted
differently, thinking about all kinds of ways how you would want to respond
differently next time.

Do not worry! It is not your fault! All humans react like that to negative
feedback. We lose our true personality and go into a so called fight-or-flight
mode. In that mode the only thing that matters to us how to avoid the perceived
danger. The relationships involved, the truthfulness of the situation or
long-term impact are completely ignored.

This is just being a normal human. But if others react the same way, then this
might not be the right path towards the open conversation we desire, right?

Let's have a look what other options exist!

## Our reaction to positive feedback

Of course, if we can give negative feedback, we can also give positive
feedback, e.g, through praise and fluttering.

How did you feel the last time someone praised you?

It might have made you smile and blush. You might have felt confident and
fulfilled. It might have made you like the other person more.

This sounds a lot more positive, right? However, did it also make you feel
energized to change? Probably not so much. And change is actually what we aim
for when we have a serious conversation, right?

Okay, so we are not yet at the right kind of feedback. But we can already see,
why we and others often choose to not have these conversations. With negative
feedback we encourage a fight-or-flight self defense reaction that even might
end up hurting us. With positive feedback we might even get liked more by the
other person, even though we don't encourage any change. 

We have to look further. There should be some kind of feedback that doesn't
create a fight-or-flight reaction and encourages change!

## Our reaction to encouraging feedback

It might be much harder to remember, but you likely also received encouraging
feedback at some point in your life. You started off at point `X`, then
discussed the topic with someone, maybe a parent or a teacher or a friend, and
ended up at a place where you felt you had an action plan, motivation to get
started and felt certain that you could end up at `X+1` or better.

How did it make you feel?

You might have had an out-of-your-body experience, where the topic, the
whiteboard or the software you were working in where your main focus. You may
have felt excitement and creativity flowing through your system. It might have
felt like a ping pong of ideas between you and the other person, hierarchies
and politeness vanishing, everybody knowing that this discussion was about
growth and ideas.

That looks like the kind of discussion we want to have with other people,
right?

But how did we get there? I've mentioned earlier that you might have had this
kind of experience with a parent, teacher or friend. That was on purpose.
Because likely you had this experience with someone you trusted. And probably
it was when you asked them for help with something where you wanted to change
yourself. For instance, you might have wanted to understand a complex topic in
your biology classes, you might have wanted to start a new hobby and were not
sure what you are good at, or you did not understand why the other person
reacted in a certain way and were curious about learning their view from them.

And there it is: Helping each other is the way to keep the discussion
constructive and serious and if it works out the end result is that at least
one person goes out of the conversation with the courage to change something.

## But what if the other person is not asking for help?

TODO: Offering help? Maybe not. Asking for help? Maybe better. How to do it?
